# Learned Motion Matching (Work in progress)

A neural-network-based generative models for character animation

The system takes user controls as input to automatically produce high quality motions that achieves the desired control. Implemented neural network models such as autoregression and autoencoders using Pytorch/Libtorch in C++ for better
performance and execution time;
